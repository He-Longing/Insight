What is in it for you? You will be working in a team of AI researchers who have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of deep learning and have considerable experience in applying deep learning to different problems. Our group has a well established reputation in developing AI solutions for digital pathology image analysis, radiology images and digital health. You will have the opportunity to learn and hone your AI skills through this project as well as by learning from other on-going projects in the team. You will receive training and guidance to be in the niche area of applying deep learning for bioimage analysis applications. You will learn both AI along with guiding clinical/medical knowledge in this project. This will be the differentiating factor for you as an AI scientist at our lab. You will also learn to sharpen your communication, collaboration, project management and leadership skills.

# Responsibilities
1. Develop AI methodologies to perform computer assisted diagnostics.
2. Work closely with collaborators to fully understand the clinical problems.
3. Design and conduct the experiments to assess the proposed AI modelsâ€™ performance.
4. Collaborate with the team members via discussions, study groups, guiding students/
interns/research officers.
5. Periodically present the progress to the group and submit the research findings to top-tier
journals and conferences

# Requirements
1. Undergraduate, masters or PhD with a strong background in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering or relevant fields.
2. Prior knowledge in machine learning and prior domain knowledge medical image analysis is NOT REQUIRED. Training for these domains will be provided on the job.
