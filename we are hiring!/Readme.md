What is in it for you? You will be working in a team of AI researchers who have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of deep learning and have considerable experience in applying deep learning to different problems. Our group has a well established reputation in developing AI solutions for digital pathology image analysis, radiology images and digital health. You will have the opportunity to learn and hone your AI skills through this project as well as by learning from other on-going projects in the team. You will receive training and guidance to be in the niche area of applying deep learning for bioimage analysis applications. You will learn both AI along with guiding clinical/medical knowledge in this project. This will be the differentiating factor for you as an AI scientist at our lab. You will also learn to sharpen your communication, collaboration, project management and leadership skills.

# Responsibilities
1. Develop AI methodologies to perform computer assisted diagnostics.
2. Work closely with collaborators to fully understand the clinical problems.
3. Design and conduct the experiments to assess the proposed AI modelsâ€™ performance.
4. Collaborate with the team members via discussions, study groups, guiding students/
interns/research officers.
5. Periodically present the progress to the group and submit the research findings to top-tier journals and conferences. 

# Requirements
1. Undergraduate, masters or PhD with a strong background in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering or relevant fields.
2. Prior knowledge in machine learning and prior domain knowledge medical image analysis is REQUIRED. Further training for these domains will be provided on the job.

4. Good communication skills, a team player and willing to share ideas and knowledge with peers.
6. Candidates should be able to work in a fast paced environment.

# Tianyi's comment
Due to the high volume of applicants, I would like to provide some guidelines for everyone to follow in order to increase efficiency:
1. For all applicants (exclude Software Engineer position), it is necessary to have a good FIRST-AUTHOR conference publication or journal publication that has ALREADY been published before submitting your application. Examples include CVPR, AAAI, MICCAI, and journals such as T-PAMI, TMI, MedIA, TBME, JBHI. Besides computer vision, NLP experts are also welcome.
2. For internships, we prefer to hire someone who is already in Singapore so that they can start working as soon as possible. If you are not located in Singapore, we can apply for a visa for you, but please note that this process can take a long time. Additionally, our hiring process also take some time. Please be aware of these factors when applying from overseas.
3. For Post-doc research fellows, we are looking for someone who has already published several high-quality papers and comes from a well-established institute such as NUS, NTU, etc. If you are not a Singaporean, we will apply for an employment pass for you.
4. We are also hiring Software Engineers for another project. You can find more information about this opportunity here: https://github.com/sagizty/Insight/blob/main/we%20are%20hiring!/2023_0411_Apollo_JD.pdf
5. All applicants must have fluent English communication skills and excellent cooperation abilities. Our office is a multinational environment, and English is the official language of Singapore.
6. When submitting your application, please provide a well-formatted email introducing yourself and attach your CV. Thank you.
